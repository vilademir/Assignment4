Code:
I only figured out how to get the mean and median wait time, as well as
the longest wait time. Corey McCrea helped me with my segmentation fault i was
having. For some reason, when it reads a file, it only reads the first line when it asks
for time of each student

List of Files:
Queue.h
Queue.cpp
Simulation.h
Simulation.cpp
main.cpp
Students.h
Students.cpp
ListNode.h
GenDoublyLinkedList.h
